This downloads hd pictures from the net and changes the background periodically, eliminating the same boring background. Add it to startup script to make it start automatically.

just run the BC2.py after downloading the pics by running BC.py

Warning, BC.py is in a while loop so itll have to be manually stopped else itll keep downloading pictures

cheers

## A simple web-scrapping implementation in Python

Here, I have used `requests` and the `BeautifulSoup` moudule to make it happen.


You can read further on `BeautifulSoup` on `https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/` 


Use the code only for educational purposes.


Make sure the web-page which you scrape allows you to do it. And its a public web-page.


#### Happy coding!

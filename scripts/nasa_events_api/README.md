Background:  
I have some experience in Computer Science, focusing on Software Development, acting mostly on the following subject: Open Educational Robotics.

Purpose:  
My team was participating of Nasa Space Apps Challenge and we wanted to work - at first - on a python script that could return some events on NASA'S EONET API based on its ID.

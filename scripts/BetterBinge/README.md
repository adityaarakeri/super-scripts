# BetterBinge

This is a Python Script powered by OpenCV Library

It uses various pre-given Templates for Template matching, and searches in the screen for a matching button.

It uses a pytogui library to take a screenshot for reference and to click once the matching template is found.

It is a lightweight script.

The script runs in infinite loop and to break the loop, just place the cursor at the topmost left corner.

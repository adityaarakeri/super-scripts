The above program,'tinderBot.py', is a life safer as it saves you from
the hassles of swiping right on everyone(supposedly that's what you do)
untill you run out of likes! It uses Selenium to automate and login to
your Tinder account and runs a loop that likes every profile untill you
eventually run out of any more likes and then closes the pop-up. Running
this program a single time gets me atleast 3-4 matches. Damn!

# PYTHON SCRIPT FOR FINDING DUPLICATE FILES
---
### Searches for files that have matching content using a hashing/checksum algorithm
---
**checksum**

A checksum is a sequence of numbers and letters used to check data for errors. If you know the checksum of an original file, you can use a checksum utility to confirm your copy is identical.

Typical algorithms used for this include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.Here MD5 was used

**algorithm**

The algorithm uses a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a string (a sequence of numbers and letters) of a fixed length.Checksums are also called “hashes”.

**applications**
    -to check files and other data for errors that occur during transmission or storage. 
    -to verify the integrity of any other type of file-applications,documents,media etc..

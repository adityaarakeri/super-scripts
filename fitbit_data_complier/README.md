# Fitbit Data Compiler

## About
This script compiles all the personal files that has been collected by your fitbit. To get your own data, follow this link [here](https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1133).

The script is very basic, and just provides the avenue for people with fitbits to compile all the files into a single dataframe. 

## Why is this useful?
This is useful for those who own a fitbit, or have a fitbit API and would like to perform analysis and play around with their own data. 

## What do I need?
In order to run this script, you would need to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and run Jupyter notebook on it. 

Alternatively, you could also upload the script along with your fitbit data and run it on Google Colab - completely on the cloud.

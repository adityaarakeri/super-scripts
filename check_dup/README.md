# Application Opener
## Overview:

This script checks through a directory to see if there are any duplicates.

## Why would you find that useful?

It's useful so you don't need to open and close every file to see if you have any unnecessary files.


## How would you setup your own startup script?

1. As long as it is executable it should work (a quick "chmod +x" should do the trick)
2. The full path of the directory you're checking is an input, so keep that copied (everything else will be prompted to you)

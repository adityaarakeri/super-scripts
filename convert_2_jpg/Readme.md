## Convert 2 JPG 

When dealing with older systems that require you to upload images, such as defect tracking applications or expense management solutions, it seems like they all accept JPEG images but rarely accept newer formats, such as PNG or HEIC.

To resolve this issue, hereâ€™s a quick utility that will take the input file and convert it to a .jpg version using the same base name.

# Requirements:

This script requires the Image plugin to be installed.

To install this plugin run the following command in the command prompt 

python3 -m pip install Image

# To Run the Script:

Open command prompt.

python3 convert_2_jpg.py <file_name>

It converts images into jpg to upload into your old Dynamics expense reporting system

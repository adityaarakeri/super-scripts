# Automated SteamVR Startup

A batch file that automates the process of opening SteamVR.


## DO THIS BEFORE USING PROGRAM!

On the lines 3 and 23, replace the '...\' with whatever path leads to your Steam directory.
For instance:
Instead of "...\Steam\", my path is "E:\Steam\"
Instead of "...\Steam\steamapps\Common\SteamVR\bin\win64", my path is "E:\Steam\steamapps\Common\SteamVR\bin\win64"


## Usage

I intend this program to be ran right after restarting your computer, to ensure optimal VR performance.
Simply run the batch file (preferably as administrator) and go put on your VR headset!

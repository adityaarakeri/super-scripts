class ChosenInlineResult(TelegramObject):
    """
    Represents a result of an inline query that was chosen by the user and sent to their chat
    partner.

    Note:
        In Python `from` is a reserved word, use `from_user` instead.

    Attributes:
        result_id (:obj:`str`): The unique identifier for the result that was chosen.
        from_user (:class:`telegram.User`): The user that chose the result.
        location (:class:`telegram.Location`): Optional. Sender location.
        inline_message_id (:obj:`str`): Optional. Identifier of the sent inline message.
        query (:obj:`str`): The query that was used to obtain the result.

    Args:
        result_id (:obj:`str`): The unique identifier for the result that was chosen.
        from_user (:class:`telegram.User`): The user that chose the result.
        location (:class:`telegram.Location`, optional): Sender location, only for bots that
            require user location.
        inline_message_id (:obj:`str`, optional): Identifier of the sent inline message. Available
            only if there is an inline keyboard attached to the message. Will be also received in
            callback queries and can be used to edit the message.
        query (:obj:`str`): The query that was used to obtain the result.
        **kwargs (:obj:`dict`): Arbitrary keyword arguments.

"""This module contains an object that represents a Telegram Dice."""

    """
    This object represents an animated emoji with a random value for currently supported base
    emoji. (The singular form of "dice" is "die". However, PTB mimics the Telegram API, which uses
    the term "dice".)

    Note:
        If :attr:`emoji` is "üéØ", a value of 6 currently represents a bullseye, while a value of 1
        indicates that the dartboard was missed. However, this behaviour is undocumented and might
        be changed by Telegram.

        If :attr:`emoji` is "üèÄ", a value of 4 or 5 currently score a basket, while a value of 1 to
        3 indicates that the basket was missed. However, this behaviour is undocumented and might
        be changed by Telegram.

    Attributes:
        value (:obj:`int`): Value of the dice.
        emoji (:obj:`str`): Emoji on which the dice throw animation is based.

    Args:
        value (:obj:`int`): Value of the dice. 1-6 for dice and darts, 1-5 for basketball.
        emoji (:obj:`str`): Emoji on which the dice throw animation is based.

from telegram import ReplyMarkup


class ReplyKeyboardMarkup(ReplyMarkup):
    """This object represents a custom keyboard with reply options.

    Attributes:
        keyboard (List[List[:class:`telegram.KeyboardButton` | :obj:`str`]]): Array of button rows.
        resize_keyboard (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Requests clients to resize the keyboard.
        one_time_keyboard (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as
            it's been used.
        selective (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Show the keyboard to specific users only.

    Example:
        A user requests to change the bot's language, bot replies to the request with a keyboard
        to select the new language. Other users in the group don't see the keyboard.

    Args:
        keyboard (List[List[:obj:`str` | :class:`telegram.KeyboardButton`]]): Array of button rows,
                each represented by an Array of :class:`telegram.KeyboardButton` objects.
        resize_keyboard (:obj:`bool`, optional): Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically
            for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of
            buttons). Defaults to false, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the same
            height as the app's standard keyboard. Defaults to ``False``
        one_time_keyboard (:obj:`bool`, optional): Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as
            it's been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically
            display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat - the user can press a special button in
            the input field to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to ``False``.
        selective (:obj:`bool`, optional): Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to
            specific users only. Targets:

            1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object
            2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original
               message.

            Defaults to ``False``.

        **kwargs (:obj:`dict`): Arbitrary keyword arguments.

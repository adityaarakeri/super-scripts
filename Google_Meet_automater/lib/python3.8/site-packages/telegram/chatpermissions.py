from telegram import TelegramObject


class ChatPermissions(TelegramObject):
    """Describes actions that a non-administrator user is allowed to take in a chat.

    Note:
        Though not stated explicitly in the offical docs, Telegram changes not only the permissions
        that are set, but also sets all the others to :obj:`False`. However, since not documented,
        this behaviour may change unbeknown to PTB.

    Attributes:
        can_send_messages (:obj:`bool`): Optional. True, if the user is allowed to send text
            messages, contacts, locations and venues.
        can_send_media_messages (:obj:`bool`): Optional. True, if the user is allowed to send
            audios, documents, photos, videos, video notes and voice notes, implies
            :attr:`can_send_messages`.
        can_send_polls (:obj:`bool`): Optional. True, if the user is allowed to send polls, implies
            :attr:`can_send_messages`.
        can_send_other_messages (:obj:`bool`): Optional. True, if the user is allowed to send
            animations, games, stickers and use inline bots, implies
            :attr:`can_send_media_messages`.
        can_add_web_page_previews (:obj:`bool`): Optional. True, if the user is allowed to add web
            page previews to their messages, implies :attr:`can_send_media_messages`.
        can_change_info (:obj:`bool`): Optional. True, if the user is allowed to change the chat
            title, photo and other settings. Ignored in public supergroups.
        can_invite_users (:obj:`bool`): Optional. True, if the user is allowed to invite new users
            to the chat.
        can_pin_messages (:obj:`bool`): Optional. True, if the user is allowed to pin messages.
            Ignored in public supergroups.

## Check JSON

This script will read a file and either pass the file as being a valid JSON file, or die a horrible death. But for all practical reasons, it tells me if the error is in the file or the program that I am trying to load the file into.

# To Run the Script:

Open command prompt.

python3 check_json.py <json file_name>

It returns Valid Json if the file is a valid json file.
